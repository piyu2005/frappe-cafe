# The frontend is a Vue SPA served at the site root — every sub-path (e.g.
# /settings, /write/abc123) needs to resolve to the same www/index.html
# entry point so Vue Router can take over client-side, not 404 on a direct
# link or a page refresh. Werkzeug's `path` converter requires at least one
# path segment, so this only covers non-root paths; the bare "/" itself
# goes through `home_page`/`role_home_page` below instead.
#
# No password anywhere in this app means frappe core's own password-reset
# flow (and its hardcoded /update-password email link) never gets
# triggered - no need for a dedicated static rule ahead of this catch-all
# the way that path once needed (see git history for that mechanism, still
# relevant if this app ever reintroduces password-based accounts).

# System User would also hand out desk/backend access). Without this, login
# falls through Frappe's default resolution with nothing configured and
# lands on /desk — the backend admin UI, not this app. Administrator/System
# User accounts are unaffected: frappe/www/login.py only consults
# role_home_page for user_type == "Website User", they're hardcoded to
# /desk regardless.
