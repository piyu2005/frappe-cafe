"""Thumbnails for the app's Builder pages, shown in Builder's folder view.

Builder makes a thumbnail when a page is saved in its editor, in a background
job. The pages of this app are imported from files, so nothing makes one, and
the folder view shows blank cards. This makes the missing or out-of-date ones
after every migrate, as the Administrator: Builder renders the page as that
user, so a page that needs a sign-in shows its content instead of a redirect.
