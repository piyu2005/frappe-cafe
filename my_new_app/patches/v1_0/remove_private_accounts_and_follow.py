	use the same doctype and stay), the notifications only follow created,
	and the User.is_private custom field.

	This patch does not delete the Follow Request doctype or the unused
	is_private column. Migrate already removes a doctype whose code is gone
	(remove_orphan_doctypes). Frappe never drops a column on its own, and an
	unused column does no harm. Both are risky changes for only a small
	benefit, so leave them to Frappe."""
